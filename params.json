  "body": "### Introduction\r\nIJIT (**I**nterface for **J**ust-**I**n-**T**ime translation) is an API which helps users to transform their [transition-system] based algorithms to a version that can operate directly on [Boolean Programs]. Said an API avoids converting a Boolean program to a transition system up front, as up-front conversion usually incurs state space blowup.\r\n\r\n### Get Started\r\nAssuming you have downloaded () API [IJIT], we will now guided you through the process of using IJIT to transform your [transition-system] based algorithms to Boolean program based algorithm with little programing effort.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPeizun Liu (@lpzun) and [Thomas Wahl] (http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/wahl/) are the main contributors. Peizun Liu is the main developer. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
